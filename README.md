- Please refrain from changing any fields other than cells highlighted for input (peach color).
- You may change the formulae in other cells if you want see how different design parameters effect other design values and output.
- Some values required for design as per IS 456 and other relevant codes are pre-filled. But just check if there are any new amendments or updated design guidelines and codal provisions.
- Use this as a learning tool - have fun and enjoy the process.
- `Output will always come, it's the right process that gives better output`.
